netcrawl

A 3 part app that scans the entire internet for web and ftp servers
The 3 parts communicate using redis as a message queue

chunker:
	Stupidly segments the internet into /24 chunks
	Sends a task to into the redis input queue with an id and a ip range

scanner:
	Do a crazy nmap scan to get some info on ports 21, 80, 443, 8000, 8080

results:
	The current results app currently just prints out whatever is sent into the
	queue
